# servidor
A server manager for managing servers. Built on Laravel, using Semantic-UI-Vue for the frontend.

## Installation
...is pretty much the same as any other Laravel app.

Don't forget to `composer install`, `npm run build` and all that jazz.

## Contributing
Servidor is very much a work in progress. If you'd like to help out, pull requests can be posted to the develop branch.
